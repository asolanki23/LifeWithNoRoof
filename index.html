              There was a lot of moving around trying to find a roof over our
              heads. We lived with family members at first until my mother
              <br />
              <br />decided to move again, she figured we were a burden to them,
              and she didn't want to cause them any trouble.

            <p>
              Then we stayed for a few days with friends after moving to stay in
              shelters. It was hard to remain in shelters because it <br />
              <br />meant we had to stay with others we did not know and trust.

              The experience was awful, we had to sleep on the hard floor, it
              stank, and often because the shelters <br />
              <br />
              were full, we were dismissed from the shelter, which meant
              sleeping on the streets.

              More than 30% of homeless individuals have a care background and

              There is a legal right to safe accommodation for young adults who

              complete their education and make the transition to independent
              living, they should also receive wider support. However, despite
              these legal protections, funding cuts by local councils have
              resulted in the lack of housing and resources to young people,
              leaving already disadvantaged children homeless and at risk of
              violence, sexual assault, ill health, and crime.

            Being a kid and being homeless is not easy. If they look at you
            differently, you wonder <br />what others would think, so you keep
            it secret, buried away where no one knows.
          </p>

          <p class="section5text2">
            I came to discover that the trouble with burying things and not
            noticing them, is that <br />
            they grow inside of you unchecked until they become so great that
            they have nowhere <br />to go but out.
          </p>

          <p class="section5text3">
            This monster that was homelessness ate away at me and made me not
            only ashamed <br />
            but angry-angry at my mother, angry at myself, angry at the world,

            What I didn't know then was that I wasn't meant to be upset or
            embarrassed, and <br />
            I realize now is that just because I was homeless, I am no less than
            anyone. It <br />
            taught me a lot while staying in the shelters, like there are more
            people than just me <br />
            who understand the things I've been through.
          </p>

          <p class="section6text2">
            People are there for all. Someone who, as we come into the
            community, helps us find <br />
            a place, meet new people and someone who supports us. To be honest,
            being<br />
            homeless now that I'm older and on my own is always something I deal
            with.

            I'm always going from house to house and going from shelter to
